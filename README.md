https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity

In this project, i build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project will help me practice your programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.
